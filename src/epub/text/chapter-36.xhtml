			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XXXVI</h2>
			<p>A few days later Philip went to London. The curate had recommended rooms in Barnes, and these Philip engaged by letter at fourteen shillings a week. He reached them in the evening; and the landlady, a funny little old woman with a shrivelled body and a deeply wrinkled face, had prepared high tea for him. Most of the sitting-room was taken up by the sideboard and a square table; against one wall was a sofa covered with horsehair, and by the fireplace an armchair to match: there was a white antimacassar over the back of it, and on the seat, because the springs were broken, a hard cushion.</p>
			<p>After having his tea he unpacked and arranged his books, then he sat down and tried to read; but he was depressed. The silence in the street made him slightly uncomfortable, and he felt very much alone.</p>
			<p>Next day he got up early. He put on his tailcoat and the tall hat which he had worn at school; but it was very shabby, and he made up his mind to stop at the Stores on his way to the office and buy a new one. When he had done this he found himself in plenty of time and so walked along the Strand. The office of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Herbert Carter &amp; <abbr>Co.</abbr> was in a little street off Chancery Lane, and he had to ask his way two or three times. He felt that people were staring at him a great deal, and once he took off his hat to see whether by chance the label had been left on. When he arrived he knocked at the door; but no one answered, and looking at his watch he found it was barely half past nine; he supposed he was too early. He went away and ten minutes later returned to find an office-boy, with a long nose, pimply face, and a Scotch accent, opening the door. Philip asked for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Herbert Carter. He had not come yet.</p>
			<p>“When will he be here?”</p>
			<p>“Between ten and half past.”</p>
			<p>“I’d better wait,” said Philip.</p>
			<p>“What are you wanting?” asked the office-boy.</p>
			<p>Philip was nervous, but tried to hide the fact by a jocose manner.</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m going to work here if you have no objection.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, you’re the new articled clerk? You’d better come in. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy’ll be here in a while.”</p>
			<p>Philip walked in, and as he did so saw the office-boy⁠—he was about the same age as Philip and called himself a junior clerk⁠—look at his foot. He flushed and, sitting down, hid it behind the other. He looked round the room. It was dark and very dingy. It was lit by a skylight. There were three rows of desks in it and against them high stools. Over the chimneypiece was a dirty engraving of a prizefight. Presently a clerk came in and then another; they glanced at Philip and in an undertone asked the office-boy (Philip found his name was Macdougal) who he was. A whistle blew, and Macdougal got up.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy’s come. He’s the managing clerk. Shall I tell him you’re here?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, please,” said Philip.</p>
			<p>The office-boy went out and in a moment returned.</p>
			<p>“Will you come this way?”</p>
			<p>Philip followed him across the passage and was shown into a room, small and barely furnished, in which a little, thin man was standing with his back to the fireplace. He was much below the middle height, but his large head, which seemed to hang loosely on his body, gave him an odd ungainliness. His features were wide and flattened, and he had prominent, pale eyes; his thin hair was sandy; he wore whiskers that grew unevenly on his face, and in places where you would have expected the hair to grow thickly there was no hair at all. His skin was pasty and yellow. He held out his hand to Philip, and when he smiled showed badly decayed teeth. He spoke with a patronising and at the same time a timid air, as though he sought to assume an importance which he did not feel. He said he hoped Philip would like the work; there was a good deal of drudgery about it, but when you got used to it, it was interesting; and one made money, that was the chief thing, wasn’t it? He laughed with his odd mixture of superiority and shyness.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carter will be here presently,” he said. “He’s a little late on Monday mornings sometimes. I’ll call you when he comes. In the meantime I must give you something to do. Do you know anything about bookkeeping or accounts?”</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered Philip.</p>
			<p>“I didn’t suppose you would. They don’t teach you things at school that are much use in business, I’m afraid.” He considered for a moment. “I think I can find you something to do.”</p>
			<p>He went into the next room and after a little while came out with a large cardboard box. It contained a vast number of letters in great disorder, and he told Philip to sort them out and arrange them alphabetically according to the names of the writers.</p>
			<p>“I’ll take you to the room in which the articled clerk generally sits. There’s a very nice fellow in it. His name is Watson. He’s a son of Watson, Crag, and Thompson⁠—you know⁠—the brewers. He’s spending a year with us to learn business.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy led Philip through the dingy office, where now six or eight clerks were working, into a narrow room behind. It had been made into a separate apartment by a glass partition, and here they found Watson sitting back in a chair, reading The Sportsman. He was a large, stout young man, elegantly dressed, and he looked up as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy entered. He asserted his position by calling the managing clerk Goodworthy. The managing clerk objected to the familiarity, and pointedly called him <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Watson, but Watson, instead of seeing that it was a rebuke, accepted the title as a tribute to his gentlemanliness.</p>
			<p>“I see they’ve scratched Rigoletto,” he said to Philip, as soon as they were left alone.</p>
			<p>“Have they?” said Philip, who knew nothing about horse-racing.</p>
			<p>He looked with awe upon Watson’s beautiful clothes. His tailcoat fitted him perfectly, and there was a valuable pin artfully stuck in the middle of an enormous tie. On the chimneypiece rested his tall hat; it was saucy and bell-shaped and shiny. Philip felt himself very shabby. Watson began to talk of hunting⁠—it was such an infernal bore having to waste one’s time in an infernal office, he would only be able to hunt on Saturdays⁠—and shooting: he had ripping invitations all over the country and of course he had to refuse them. It was infernal luck, but he wasn’t going to put up with it long; he was only in this internal hole for a year, and then he was going into the business, and he would hunt four days a week and get all the shooting there was.</p>
			<p>“You’ve got five years of it, haven’t you?” he said, waving his arm round the tiny room.</p>
			<p>“I suppose so,” said Philip.</p>
			<p>“I daresay I shall see something of you. Carter does our accounts, you know.”</p>
			<p>Philip was somewhat overpowered by the young gentleman’s condescension. At Blackstable they had always looked upon brewing with civil contempt, the Vicar made little jokes about the beerage, and it was a surprising experience for Philip to discover that Watson was such an important and magnificent fellow. He had been to Winchester and to Oxford, and his conversation impressed the fact upon one with frequency. When he discovered the details of Philip’s education his manner became more patronising still.</p>
			<p>“Of course, if one doesn’t go to a public school those sort of schools are the next best thing, aren’t they?”</p>
			<p>Philip asked about the other men in the office.</p>
			<p>“Oh, I don’t bother about them much, you know,” said Watson. “Carter’s not a bad sort. We have him to dine now and then. All the rest are awful bounders.”</p>
			<p>Presently Watson applied himself to some work he had in hand, and Philip set about sorting his letters. Then <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy came in to say that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carter had arrived. He took Philip into a large room next door to his own. There was a big desk in it, and a couple of big armchairs; a Turkey carpet adorned the floor, and the walls were decorated with sporting prints. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carter was sitting at the desk and got up to shake hands with Philip. He was dressed in a long frock coat. He looked like a military man; his moustache was waxed, his gray hair was short and neat, he held himself upright, he talked in a breezy way, he lived at Enfield. He was very keen on games and the good of the country. He was an officer in the Hertfordshire Yeomanry and chairman of the Conservative Association. When he was told that a local magnate had said no one would take him for a City man, he felt that he had not lived in vain. He talked to Philip in a pleasant, offhand fashion. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy would look after him. Watson was a nice fellow, perfect gentleman, good sportsman⁠—did Philip hunt? Pity, <em>the</em> sport for gentlemen. Didn’t have much chance of hunting now, had to leave that to his son. His son was at Cambridge, he’d sent him to Rugby, fine school Rugby, nice class of boys there, in a couple of years his son would be articled, that would be nice for Philip, he’d like his son, thorough sportsman. He hoped Philip would get on well and like the work, he mustn’t miss his lectures, they were getting up the tone of the profession, they wanted gentlemen in it. Well, well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy was there. If he wanted to know anything <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy would tell him. What was his handwriting like? Ah well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Goodworthy would see about that.</p>
			<p>Philip was overwhelmed by so much gentlemanliness: in East Anglia they knew who were gentlemen and who weren’t, but the gentlemen didn’t talk about it.</p>
